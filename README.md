# KeyTAR
KeyTAR is a keystroke timing extraction and inference framework that demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing user input using only inter-keystroke timing information. While side-channel researchers have long speculated about the potential for such reconstruction, KeyTAR proves the vulnerability is realâ€”leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer typed input from timing data alone.

The attack consists of two main components:

1. Keystroke Extraction: Collects inter-keystroke timings through microarchitectural side-channel techniques.

2. Keystroke Inference: Uses the extracted timings to infer the original typed input.

This repository contains the **keystroke extraction** portion of the attack.

### ./flush_reload
This directory contains a visualization tool for analyzing Flush+Reload side-channel traces against ground truth kernel function usage. Refer to the README inside the folder for detailed instructions and usage.

### ./native_simulation and ./web-simulation
These directories include tools for simulating Prime+Probe attacks in native and web environments, respectively. They support replaying keystrokes using our public dataset. Please see the README in each folder for setup and execution details.
